# E-Portfolio on GitHub Pages

This repository hosts a professional e-portfolio site, showcasing projects, experience, and background. The site is built for clarity and ease of navigation, and is published via **GitHub Pages**.

## Learning outcomes

Through this project I applied and reinforced the following:

**HTML & structure**
- Working with semantic HTML (headings, sections, headers, navigation) and how they shape both layout and accessibility.
- Controlling line breaks and paragraph flow using `<br>` and block-level elements so content reads well on the page.
- Editing template markup safely: updating titles, headings, and copy while keeping the existing structure and asset paths intact.

**Template customization**
- Customizing a responsive HTML/CSS template (Forty by HTML5 UP): replacing placeholder content, updating the site title and header branding, and adjusting call-to-action labels to match the purpose of the site.
- Using CSS to modify template behaviour (e.g. hiding or showing the menu control) by targeting existing selectors, without breaking the template’s layout or scripts.
- Understanding how template assets (CSS, JS, images) are organized and referenced so that relative paths work correctly when the site is served from the repository root.

**Deployment & tooling**
- Configuring a static site for **GitHub Pages**: ensuring the main entry point is `index.html` at the repository root and that all asset paths resolve correctly in the published environment.
- Managing the relationship between Markdown (e.g. `index.md`) and static HTML so that the intended `index.html` is the one served as the homepage when using GitHub Pages (and, where relevant, Jekyll).
